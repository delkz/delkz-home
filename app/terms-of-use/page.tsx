                <p>Welcome to my online portfolio! I would like to clarify some information about the elements and inspiration used in the development of this website.</p>

                <h2 className="font-bold mt-4">1. Exclusive Development</h2>
                <p>This website was fully developed by me from scratch, based on my skills and creativity as a developer. The layout was inspired by the <strong>Space</strong> template, available on <a className="underline" href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/space/" target="_blank">Colorlib</a>. No code or resources from the original template were directly reused; the design served solely as a reference for creating something unique.</p>

                <h2 className="font-bold mt-4">2. Graphic Elements</h2>
                <p>The decorative wavy lines beneath the section titles were sourced from the resource &quot;Wavy Line Isolated on White Background,&quot; available on <a className="underline" href="https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/10683213-wavy-line-isolated-on-white-background" target="_blank">Vecteezy</a>. These elements were incorporated in compliance with the platform&apos;s usage terms.</p>
                <p>The icons used were sourced from Heroicons, an open-source icon library widely known for its versatility and minimalist design. These icons were used in compliance with the permissions and licenses provided by the platform.</p>

                <h2 className="font-bold mt-4">3. Acknowledgments and Licenses</h2>
                <p>The visual elements used on the site, such as the wavy lines, are properly credited and used according to the terms provided by their creators. I extend my gratitude to the creators and platforms for offering valuable resources to the community.</p>

                <h2 className="font-bold mt-4">4. Contact</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions about the development of this website or need further information about the elements used, feel free to reach out through the contact form provided.</p>
